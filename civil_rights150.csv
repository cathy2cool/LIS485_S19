1326,petition,Grant voters the ability to vote for the President of the United States by dissolving the electoral college.,"The elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000 produced an Electoral College winner who did not receive the plurality of the nationwide popular vote - that is, the American people did not get the President democracy should have selected.Due to the way electoral votes are allocated, candidates have a strong incentive to focus their campaigns on ""swing"" states with many voters, such as Florida, and neglect states such as Texas which do not swing.   Due to necessary rounding errors when allocating votes, members of a sparsely populated state effectively accrue more voting power than members of a well-populated state.

Windsor, legally married couples living in 38 of the 50 states remain vulnerable to discrimination under federal law.When determining an individual's marital status, some federal agencies refer to the marriage laws of the person's state of residence, whereas others refer to the law of the state where a marriage was celebrated. Using the criteria of the state of residence would deprive many same-sex couples of rights conferred by federal law.We petition President Obama to issue an executive order instructing all federal agencies to refer to the law of the state in which a marriage was celebrated when determining marital status for the purposes of federal law.

According to the Bureau of Justice, the estimate of women raped in one year in the United States is approximately 300,000; however, according to the Centers for Disease Control, the estimate is 1.3 million. We need to stop ignoring rape in the United States, and a way to start is by creating laws that bring only justice to the victims and treat rapists just as they are; criminals.
